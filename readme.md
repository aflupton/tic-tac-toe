## Description
A program for a simple game of luck called Pig Dice, where two players roll a single die with the objective of being the first player to accumulate 100 points.

## Specs
- 2 players are required to play.
- Players click the "roll" button to roll, and the "hold" button to hold. Each player has designated buttons, which appear at the beginning of their turn.
- The value of each roll is determined by a randomized number generating algorithm.
- A roll of 1 scores no points and play passes to the other player.
- If die numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are rolled, that number accumulates to the player's point total.
- If die numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are rolled, that player's turn continues.
- A player can decide to roll or hold at any point in their turn.
- The first player to score at least 100 points wins.
